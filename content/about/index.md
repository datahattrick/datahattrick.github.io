# Kia ora!

Welcome to my blog, a little area on the internet where I jot little things here and there.

The name is Heath, and I am a Data Platforms Engineer from New Zealand, currently specialised in transport systems like Kafka and NiFi.
I hope to slowly develop my expertise in the open source circuit and more involved.
